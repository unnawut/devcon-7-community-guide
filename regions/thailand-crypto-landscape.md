# Thailand's crypto landscape

Bangkok and Thailand overall has a thriving crypto community and a supportive regulatory environment that supports innovation and technological advancement. The Thai government has recognized the potential of blockchain technology and has made it a priority in its national development strategy, with initiatives like the Thailand 4.0 policy that seeks to leverage emerging technologies to transform the country’s economy and society.

The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has implemented progressive regulations for digital assets, including cryptocurrency exchange platforms and ICO portals, paving the way for the growth of the crypto industry. Furthermore, Thailand’s central bank, the Bank of Thailand, has developed its own blockchain-based platform for interbank transfers and a pilot version of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for Thailand.

The Ethereum community in Bangkok consists of various project teams, companies, communities and university clubs. Numerous Ethereum-related events have been organized at least since 2018 including conferences and builder’s activities. The list below illustrates the current Ethereum community, and not by any means exhaustive.
